  significance: "Also known as Bounter Jinalaya or Adiswar Bounter Jinalaya Mahatirth, this magnificent temple complex was constructed in 1982 in memory of Gun Sagar Suriswarji Mahara. Spanning an impressive 80 acres, the complex is celebrated for its elaborate octagonal design housing 72 individual shrines (deris) dedicated to various Jain Tirthankaras. At the heart stands the main temple dedicated to Lord Mahavir, the 24th Tirthankara. The extensive use of white marble, intricate carvings adorned with precious gemstones, and stunning architectural symmetry make this not only a significant pilgrimage center but also an architectural marvel that showcases the finest expressions of Jain temple artistry.",
  bestTimeToVisit: "October to March for pleasant weather. Early morning visits (6 AM - 9 AM) offer the most peaceful atmosphere for prayer and meditation. The white marble gleams beautifully in the soft morning light. Avoid visiting during the harsh summer months (April-June) as the marble can become extremely hot.",
  howToReach: "Located just 2km north of Mandvi town center, easily accessible by auto-rickshaw, taxi, or private vehicle. The temple complex has ample parking facilities. From Bhuj, it's approximately 60km via the Mandvi road. The complex also provides accommodation (Dharamsala) and dining facilities (Bhojanalaya) for pilgrims and visitors.",
