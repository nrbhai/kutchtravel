They are revered for saving the locals from the tyranny of a cruel ruler, Jam Punara. Jakhau was historically a prosperous port exporting salt, cotton, and castor oil, though trade later shifted to Mandvi and Mumbai due to silting. The port was also impacted by the 1998 cyclone but remains a vital fishing center.",
