  significance: "Kotai is a historic village containing remarkable archaeological remains including an ancient Sun temple complex dating to the earlier part of the 10th century. The main Sun temple, known as 'Ra Lakha's' and ascribed to Lakha Phulani, was built without cement using yellow and red stone. It features unique groined aisles similar to chaitya caves and exceptional roofing with massive stone slabs. The complex includes multiple temple ruins with elaborate carvings of Navagraha (nine planets), Ganpati, and various Hindu deities, representing significant medieval temple architecture on the shore of the Greater Rann of Kutch.",
